### Representational Analysis in ANNs

Experimenting with some ideas for the analysis and comparison of the learned representations in deep networks by using a bunch of information theoretic and spectral analysis methods.

The aim is to come up with a way to measure how abstract or complex a representation is and understand how it evolves on different levels and on different networks that overfits or underfits.
