# abstraction

Experimenting with some ideas. Sorry for the mess in the code.

## What's this repository about?
Some tools for analysis and comparison of the learned representations in deep networks by a bunch of information theoretic and spectral analysis methods.

Aim is to quantify abstractness of a representation and understand how it evolves in the layers.
