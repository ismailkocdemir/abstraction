### Representational Analysis in ANNs

Experimenting with some ideas for the analysis and comparison of the learned representations in deep networks by using a bunch of information theoretic and spectral analysis methods.

Aim is to quantify abstractness/semantic information of a representation and understand how it evolves in the layers.
