### Representational Analysis in ANNs

Experimenting with some ideas for the analysis and comparison of the learned representations in deep networks by using a bunch of information theoretic and spectral analysis methods.

The aim is to quantify abstractness/semantic information in the representations and understand how it evolves on different levels.
